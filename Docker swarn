Swarm has two major components:
•	An enterprise grade secure cluster:
o	Manage one or more Docker nodes as a cluster
o	Encrypted distributed cluster store
o	Encrypted networks
o	Secure join tokens
•	An orchestration engine for creating mircoservices:
o	API for deploying and managing microservices
o	Declarative manifest files for defining apps
o	Provides availability to scale apps, and perform rolling updates and rollbacks
Swarm was initially a separate product layered on Docker, since Docker 1.12 it has become a part of the engine.
The Cluster
•	A swarm consists of one or more Docker nodes.
•	Nodes are either a managers or a worker.
•	Managers:
o	Manage the state of the cluster
o	Dispatch tasks to workers
•	Workers:
o	Accepts and execute tasks
•	State is held in etcd
•	Swarm uses Transport Layer Security (TLS):
o	Encrypted communication
o	Authenticated nodes
o	Authorized roles
Orchestration
•	The atomic unit of scheduling is a swarm service.
•	The service construct adds the following to a container:
o	scaling
o	rolling updates
o	rollback
o	updates
•	A container wrapped in a service is a task or a replica.
